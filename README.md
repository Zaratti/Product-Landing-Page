# Product-Landing-Page

#### This is my product landing page example which you can always modify to suit your preference by working on the pictures and pricings for your products.

You should note that when you click the get started button, the email is submitted to a static page ( I had to use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully and you are allowed to change the form action URL .

- Kindly show appreciation by _starring_ the repository.
